# Ludum 50

## Overview
**Ludum Dare Challenge 50 -  Delay the inevitable**

This was a game jam challenge to make a game in a weekend.

This game was built with Rust on the [Bevy Engine](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy)

It's a simple platformer game where the platform shrinks over time, and the only way to extend the platform is to kill the enemies.
